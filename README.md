The next section "How to navigate this project" points me to the most important parts of the application. If the code behind these links looks OK, I'm ready to give this candidate a go.

The section "Why I built the project this way" reveals information about the reasoning behind some technical decisions. That's really great because it allows the reviewer to tap into your thought process.

A final section "If I had more time I would change this" shows that you can take a step back and self-reflect. Very important for working in a team.
